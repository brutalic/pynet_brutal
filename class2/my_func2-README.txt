Since the "#2" files are just uploaded on github, and the exercise requires to read the module from a different directory,
I have attached this instruction text file for my own sake, before anyone others'. :)
Also, the main part I am doing this step is for the "git commit" portion to be more readable, and kept under one folder.


1. Move the my_func2.py file to a different directory (in my own exercise, I moved it to "/seremetkoski/home/pynet_brutal/class1/")

2. Apply the following command from the terminal: PYTHONPATH='/home/seremetkoski/pynet_brutal/class1'

    - verify that it is there by:
        a. launching python from the terminal
        b. executing the following commmands
            - import sys
            - from pprint import pprint
            - pprint(sys.path)

3. Run the BrutalModuleRead2.py script
