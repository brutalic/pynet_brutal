Since the "#3" files are just uploaded on github, and the exercise requires to read the module from a different directory,
I have attached this instruction text file for my own sake, before anyone others'. :)
Also, the main part I am doing this step is for the "git commit" portion to be more readable, and kept under one folder.


1. Move the my_func3.py file to the recommended directory by Kirk: "~/applied_python/lib/python2.7/site-packages/"

2. Run the BrutalModuleRead3.py script

NOTE: No need to apply PYTHONPATH='~/applied_python/lib/python2.7/site-packages' like in the second exercise, because
      the listed path is already part of the default paths that python uses for modules' functioning.
