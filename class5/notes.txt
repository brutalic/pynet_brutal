# class5/site.yml is the main file. This file talks to all the files that are under the sub-directories:
# class5/roles/routers/tasks ../templates & ../vars. The site.yml is the main one and calls upon the main.yml under
# the tasks subdirectory. That sub talks to the vars main sub directory, which is also tied to the templates sub.
# etc...
